### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
In session 6, "BYO SYSKA", you bring the SYSKA! Yes, what do YOU think your colleagues should know about when it comes to digital hacks? Come prepared to share one fantastic keyboard shortcut or your number one trick for getting on top of your Outlook inbox or ... I don't know - it is your time/sanity-saving tip/trick/thing after all! :)  
We'll also take the opportunity to bust some jargon, Library Carpentry style, and spend time looking at our day-to-day workflows and how these might be sped up, stream-lined, automated.  

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
One thing you think we should know about.

## WHEN ... do I show up?
Wednesday, October 2 @ 10:30am. 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
The teach and learn part of Digi SYSKA runs for 1.5 hours. Kai will be offered during the session.

## WHERE ... do I go?
Meeting room 2, IR, Central Library.

## WHY ... should I attend Digi SYSKA?
The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun, and your participation can be cited in your Professional Development Review.
