### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
In session 3, "Google ScholaR", we will build on our knowledge of APIs and URLs gleaned from the previous session and extract citation data from Google Scholar using a package in R called "scholar". Do not fear: this is an introductory session and we will be in the very competent and capable hands of Murray.
