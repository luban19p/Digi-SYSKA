### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
In the second session, "If you're api and you know it...", we will look at using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to access GLAM metadata and cleaning data in OpenRefine. Chris will take us through the documentation and how to use an API before you get to play with some data in OpenRefine (and by "play", I mean clean it up - fun!).   

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
- [x]  Yourself
- [x]  A device (Digi SYSKA sessions are BYOD)
- [x]  Feel free to bring along a dataset with errors in it that you would like to quickly fix up

**Software: You will need to install OpenRefine on your devices (if it isn't already on there). Go to** [openrefine.org](http://openrefine.org/download.html)

## WHEN ... do I show up?
Wednesday, June 5 @ 10:30am. 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
The teach and learn part of Digi SYSKA runs for 1.5 hours. Kai will be offered during the session.

## WHERE ... do I go?
I am SUPER pleased to announce that all future Digi SYSKA sessions will take place in the remodelled RSU in the Science Library!

## WHY ... should I attend Digi SYSKA?
The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun (if coding and data manipulation are your idea of fun), and your participation can be cited in your Professional Development Review.
