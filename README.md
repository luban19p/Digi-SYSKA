### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
In the final session for 2019, we will Zoom into the world of VR - VRoom! VRoom! If researchers get to play with VR then why can't we!? Fiona will introduce us to a couple of games in order to get a feel for VR and its possibilities (and, really, just to have a bit of fun). Following on from this, the lovely Jeff Ormandy from eConferencing will give us an overview of using Zoom for individuals and provide some tips and tricks on how best to run our Zoom sessions. 

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
This time devices are optional but please, as it is the final session of the year, bring some food to share.

## WHEN ... do I show up?
Wednesday, December 4 @ 10:30am. 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
The teach and learn part of Digi SYSKA runs for 1.5 hours. Kai will be offered during the session.

## WHERE ... do I go?
Central Library Seminar Room 6 (the BIG one).

## WHY ... should I attend Digi SYSKA?
The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun, and your participation can be cited in your Professional Development Review.
