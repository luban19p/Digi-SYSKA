### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
In session 7, we continue the thread from October's "BYO SYSKA" and look at working smarter with Outlook and get a wee intro to [Trello](https://trello.com/en) with Dene. In preparation, take some time and consider the things you do with your Outlook that you might be able to share with the group - "I'll show you my Outlook if you show me yours". If there's time we'll also get Zoom up and running and see how we can use it more effectively (i.e. aside from using the airbrush filter, which I've only just found out about - thanks Fiona! :-P).    

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
Devices and something to share about how you use Outlook.

## WHEN ... do I show up?
Wednesday, November 6 @ 10:30am. 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
The teach and learn part of Digi SYSKA runs for 1.5 hours. Kai will be offered during the session.

## WHERE ... do I go?
Meeting room 2, IR, Central Library.

## WHY ... should I attend Digi SYSKA?
The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun, and your participation can be cited in your Professional Development Review.
