### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
Digi SYSKA 2020 was meant to kick off with a crowd favourite: "Get Your Sheet Together!", presented by Dene McDonald. Due to illness, we are going to move this session to the 30th of September and do a bit of jargon busting and learn about using Zoom effectively and safely in the first session on 12 August instead - thank you Jon from eConferencing for stepping in at such short notice! NB Laptops are optional for this first session.

NB Each Digi SYSKA session will cover a tool or skill that can help you in your work and/or that is used by researchers at Otago. Session content includes: Excel spreadsheets and Tidy Data, using APIs to extract metadata from e.g. Digital NZ, getting the most out of Outlook, cleaning data using OpenRefine, your digital footprint/online safety, Publish or Perish (a special bibliometrics training collab.), keyboard shortcuts, jargon busting, intro to programming languages.   

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
Digi SYSKA is BYOD (most of the time). There are limited pool laptops, so please contact me (Antje) early if you need one. 

## WHEN ... do I show up?
@10am on Wednesday, 12 August 2020! 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
The teach and learn part of Digi SYSKA runs for 1.5 hours (give or take).

## WHERE ... do I go?
Science Library Seminar Room.

## WHY ... should I attend Digi SYSKA?
The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun.
