### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
In session 7, we continue the thread from October's "BYO SYSKA" and look at working smarter with Outlook and get a wee intro to [Trello](https://trello.com/en) with Dene. In preparation, take some time and consider the things you do with 'your' Outlook that you might be able to share with the group - "I'll show you my Outlook if you show me yours". So, again, you are bringing the SYSKA! :)   

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
Devices and something to share about how you use Outlook.

## WHEN ... do I show up?
Wednesday, November 6 @ 10:30am. 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
The teach and learn part of Digi SYSKA runs for 1.5 hours. Kai will be offered during the session.

## WHERE ... do I go?
Meeting room 2, IR, Central Library.

## WHY ... should I attend Digi SYSKA?
The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun, and your participation can be cited in your Professional Development Review.
