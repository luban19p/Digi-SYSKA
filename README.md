## WHEN ... do I show up?
The first Tuesday of every month at 9:30am, starting 2 April 2019. 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
As long as you like but sessions run for around one hour, followed by morning tea.

## WHERE ... do I go?
Science Library Seminar Room (most of the time) but also Hocken seminar room, RSU offices and other locations during the Exam Period Library Seminar Room Booking Lock Out.

## WHAT ... will be covered?
The first session is on OpenRefine (a powerful data cleaning tool), and we have sessions on Excel/spreadsheets, markdown and Github lined up (suggestions for content are also welcome). We will endeavour to have lightening talks at the start of some sessions to find out what our colleagues can do with their software skills and get tips from them. 

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
Yourself, your device (OL Hacky Hours are BYOD), your stomach (there will be cake/snacks/baking). You might also need to download software but we will let you know before the relevant Ol' Hacky Hour.

## WHY ... should I attend?
Whether you attend is up to you (and your workload, of course). The sessions are entirely optional and each will consist of standalone content (so no need to worry if you miss one or two or five sessions). The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun (if coding and data manipulation are your idea of fun), and will contribute to your professional development. And there's cake.
