### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
The final (official) session of Digi SYSKA this year will be a continuation of markdown with the added bonus of GitHub pages, presented by Murray! There's nothing to download and install this week - just show up (with your device) and have fun! If you want to be extra prepared, sign up to [GitHub](https://github.com) before Wednesday.

NB Murray might offer a special session on the R Scholar package - watch this space.    

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
Digi SYSKA is BYOD (most of the time). There are limited pool laptops, so please contact me (Antje) early if you need one. 

## WHEN ... do I show up?
@10am on Wednesday, 28 October 2020. 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
The teach and learn part of Digi SYSKA runs for 1.5 hours (give or take).

## WHERE ... do I go?
Science Library Seminar Room.

## WHY ... should I attend Digi SYSKA?
The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun.
