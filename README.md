### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
The first session is on effective spreadsheeting: "Get your sheet together", and we have sessions on OpenRefine (a powerful data cleaning tool), markdown and Github lined up (suggestions for content are also welcome). We will endeavour to have lightening talks at the start of some sessions to find out what our colleagues can do with their software skills and get tips from them. 

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
[x] Yourself
[x] A device (Digi SYSKA sessions are BYOD)
[x] Your stomach (there will be cake/snacks/baking) 

You might also need to download software but we will let you know before the relevant session.

## WHEN ... do I show up?
The first Wednesday of every month at 10:30am, starting 1 May 2019. 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
Digi SYSKA sessions run for around one hour, followed by kai.

## WHERE ... do I go?
Science Library seminar room (most of the time) but also Hocken seminar room, RSU offices and other locations during the Exam Period Library Seminar Room Booking Lock Out.

## WHY ... should I attend?
Whether you attend is up to you (and your workload, of course). The monthly sessions will consist of standalone content (so no need to worry if you miss one), though there is an expectation that you commit for the year. The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun (if coding and data manipulation are your idea of fun), and will contribute to your professional development.
