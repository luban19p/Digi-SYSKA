### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
In session 3, "Google ScholaR", we will build on our knowledge of APIs and URLs gleaned from the previous session and extract citation data from Google Scholar using a package in R called "scholar". Do not fear: this is an introductory session and we will be in the very competent and capable hands of Murray. 

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
**You will need to install R and R Studio on your machines:** 
* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

## WHEN ... do I show up?
Wednesday, July 3 @ 10:30am. 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
The teach and learn part of Digi SYSKA runs for 1.5 hours. Kai will be offered during the session.

## WHERE ... do I go?
I am SUPER pleased to announce that all future Digi SYSKA sessions will take place in the remodelled RSU in the Science Library!

## WHY ... should I attend Digi SYSKA?
The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun, and your participation can be cited in your Professional Development Review.
