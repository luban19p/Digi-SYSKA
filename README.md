### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
Digi SYSKA 2020 kicks off with a crowd favourite: "Get Your Sheet Together!", presented by Dene McDonald. In this session you will get to play with a dataset in Excel and learn things you never knew Excel/you could do. While it helps to have a bit of prior knowledge of Excel, there will be helpers on hand so everyone gets something out of the session.

(NB Each session will cover a tool or skill that can help you in your work and/or that is used by researchers at Otago. Session topics could include: Excel spreadsheet functions and pivot tables, Tidy Data, using APIs to extract metadata from e.g. Digital NZ, getting the most out of Outlook, cleaning data using OpenRefine, keyboard shortcuts, jargon busting.)   

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
Digi SYSKA is BYOD (most of the time). There are limited pool laptops, so please contact me (Antje) early if you need one. 

## WHEN ... do I show up?
@10am on Wednesday, 5 August 2020! 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
The teach and learn part of Digi SYSKA runs for 1.5 hours (give or take).

## WHERE ... do I go?
Science Library Seminar Room.

## WHY ... should I attend Digi SYSKA?
The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun.
