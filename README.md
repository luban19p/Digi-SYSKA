### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
The first session is on effective spreadsheeting: "Get your sheet together". Dene and Antje will take you through some common formatting mistakes and outline the tidy data principles. You will also get to play with a dataset supplied by Dene, who will teach you some awesome functions in Excel you never knew you couldn't live without! You will also hear about the importance of good data organisation practices from a researcher at Otago.  

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
- [x]  Yourself
- [x]  A device (Digi SYSKA sessions are BYOD)
- [x]  A dataset you have that you might want to tidy up (if you have one on hand, that is)

Session 1 is on spreadsheets, so a spreadsheet programme will need to be installed on your device. Our work computers have Excel - so, we are good to go!

## WHEN ... do I show up?
Wednesday, May 1 @ 10:30am. 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
The teach and learn part of Digi SYSKA runs for 1 hour, from 10:30 - 11:30, followed by kai.

## WHERE ... do I go?
NB CHANGE IN LOCATION: Session 1 is now in St David II, 2.09 Meeting Room.

## WHY ... should I attend Digi SYSKA?
The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun (if coding and data manipulation are your idea of fun), and your participation can be cited in your Professional Development Review.
