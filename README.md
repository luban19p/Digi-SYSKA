### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
In session 5, "Digi SYSKA: The Reboot", you have the choice of revisiting Murray's R lessons or Dene's Excel lesson. We will split into two groups and focus on making these sessions as hands-on as possible. Yes, I have taken your feedback into account a la "more play time" :). We will mostly be going over what we've already learned, with maybe a couple of extra tips and tricks in the Excel session. 

Lesson materials from the previous session can be accessed below, if you would like to revise beforehand.
