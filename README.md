### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
In the second session, "If you're api and you know it...", we will look at using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to access GLAM metadata and will clean up a subset of this data using OpenRefine. Chris will take us through how to use an API key supplied by Digital NZ to get to the backend of their online database. As a nifty aside, you will learn about the structure of URLs.    

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
**You will need to install the below and sign up to Digital NZ before the session:** 
* [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/download.html)
* [Firefox browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
* [Digital NZ sign up](https://digitalnz.org/)

## WHEN ... do I show up?
Wednesday, June 5 @ 10:30am. 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
The teach and learn part of Digi SYSKA runs for 1.5 hours. Kai will be offered during the session.

## WHERE ... do I go?
I am SUPER pleased to announce that all future Digi SYSKA sessions will take place in the remodelled RSU in the Science Library!

## WHY ... should I attend Digi SYSKA?
The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun (if coding and data manipulation are your idea of fun), and your participation can be cited in your Professional Development Review.
