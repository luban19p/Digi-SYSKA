### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
The next session will introduce you to markdown. Well, the session won't, Murray Cadzow will! I am going to leave you in his very capable hands to learn a bit about markdown syntaxes using [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) as the uber-fun vehicle ("it's like Google Docs only in markdown" - Murray Cadzow). Murray might also give you an intro to GitHub pages (which is what I use to create this webpage every week!). What is markdown, you ask? Markdown is a simple syntax that formats text as headers, lists, boldface, etc. on webpages.

There's nothing to download and install this week - just show up (with your device) and have fun!

NB This is different to what I had initially told you would be taught this session (R Scholar), as we felt markdown might be more fun and immediately applicable to you. :)  

NB Each Digi SYSKA session will cover a tool or skill that can help you in your work and/or that is used by researchers at Otago. Session content could include: Excel spreadsheets and Tidy Data, using APIs to extract metadata from e.g. Digital NZ, getting the most out of Outlook, cleaning data using OpenRefine, your digital footprint/online safety, Publish or Perish (a special bibliometrics training collab.), keyboard shortcuts, jargon busting, intro to programming languages.   

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
Digi SYSKA is BYOD (most of the time). There are limited pool laptops, so please contact me (Antje) early if you need one. 

## WHEN ... do I show up?
@10am on Wednesday, 14 October 2020. 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
The teach and learn part of Digi SYSKA runs for 1.5 hours (give or take).

## WHERE ... do I go?
Science Library Seminar Room.

## WHY ... should I attend Digi SYSKA?
The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun.
