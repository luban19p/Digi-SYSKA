### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
For the second session we have David Hood coming to talk us through online safety, digital footrints, etc. I'm not certain yet how hands-on this session will be, but please bring your laptop/Macbook just in case. (I have pre-booked the 4 pool laptops for those who need one of these.)  

NB Each Digi SYSKA session will cover a tool or skill that can help you in your work and/or that is used by researchers at Otago. Session content includes: Excel spreadsheets and Tidy Data, using APIs to extract metadata from e.g. Digital NZ, getting the most out of Outlook, cleaning data using OpenRefine, your digital footprint/online safety, Publish or Perish (a special bibliometrics training collab.), keyboard shortcuts, jargon busting, intro to programming languages.   

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
Digi SYSKA is BYOD (most of the time). There are limited pool laptops, so please contact me (Antje) early if you need one. 

## WHEN ... do I show up?
@10am on Wednesday, 2 September 2020. 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
The teach and learn part of Digi SYSKA runs for 1.5 hours (give or take).

## WHERE ... do I go?
Science Library Seminar Room.

## WHY ... should I attend Digi SYSKA?
The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun.
