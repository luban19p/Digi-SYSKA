### Digi SYSKA is turning into SYSKA Bytes in 2021!

## WHAT?!!
After running a slightly-formal-ish version of Digi SYSKA in 2019 & 2020, twenty twenty-one is going to be all about the byte-sized SYSKAs (Stuff You Should Know About)! Planning is in progress, so watch this space!

Your colleagues from across the library (and maybe some outside the library ... or even outside Dunedin ... or outside New Zealand!) will be giving up a slice of their lunchbreak (30 mins max) once per month to tell you or teach you or entertain you on something they know or have learned that has made their work-life that much easier! It's all about the automation and simplification of stuff we do in the digital space that has become our "workplace"! 

So, come along when you can and learn some good Stuff You Should Know About!
