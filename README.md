### A supportive space for learning useful software skills

## WHAT ... will be covered?
The third session is a SYSKA-Bibliometrics training collab presented by Shiobhan, who will take us through Publish or Perish (a tool designed to help academics show the impact their research is having in academia by grabbing and analysing citations to their work). While PoP uses a variety of data sources, Shiobhan is going to focus on Google Scholar as it is the trickiest and messiest data source to work with on its own. Before the session, please make sure to download and install PoP on your device. For PC, use [this link](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish/windows), and for Mac use [this one](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish/os-x). 

If you have any issues installing the software, then please feel free to come along to the session 15 minutes early, and Shiobhan and I can help you out. :)        

NB Each Digi SYSKA session will cover a tool or skill that can help you in your work and/or that is used by researchers at Otago. Session content includes: Excel spreadsheets and Tidy Data, using APIs to extract metadata from e.g. Digital NZ, getting the most out of Outlook, cleaning data using OpenRefine, your digital footprint/online safety, Publish or Perish (a special bibliometrics training collab.), keyboard shortcuts, jargon busting, intro to programming languages.   

## WHAT (2) ... do I bring?
Digi SYSKA is BYOD (most of the time). There are limited pool laptops, so please contact me (Antje) early if you need one. 

## WHEN ... do I show up?
@10am on Wednesday, 16 September 2020. 

## HOW ... long do I stay?
The teach and learn part of Digi SYSKA runs for 1.5 hours (give or take).

## WHERE ... do I go?
Science Library Seminar Room.

## WHY ... should I attend Digi SYSKA?
The software skills we will delve into will be relevant to the work you do and/or the work academic staff and students at Otago do. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and fun.
